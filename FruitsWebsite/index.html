                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I designed a fruit-themed e-commerce website centered around a specific theme using public APIs. I worked as the sole UI/UX developer and web developer, handling both the design and technical parts of the website which included the planning, research, wireframes, and code.</p>
                <p>The website allows users to purchase fruit-based diet plans and emphasizes credibility through customer testimonials and informative content that supports safe purchasing decisions. Additionally, the site features a D3.js data visualization that presents weight gain and weight loss trends, helping users identify which fruits are suitable for their body goals.</p>

        <div class = "competitive-analysis">
            <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
            <p>Before starting the project, I did a competitive analysis to identify the design patterns and trends of existing food based subscription websites to better understand the user flow and packaging of these websites.</p>
            <h3>These websites included</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Hello Fresh</li>
                <li>Blue Apron</li>
                <li>Gold Belly</li>
                <li>Sun Basket</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="user-research-container">
        <div class = "user-research-text">
            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <p>To better understand the target user, I began by researching common health conditions affecting people in South Africa. This research was conducted using academic sources found on Google Scholar, which highlighted that many South Africans face diet-related health challenges such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and vitamin deficiencies. These conditions are often linked to limited access to nutritious food, affordability issues, and a lack of clear, practical dietary guidance. </p>
            <p>Through this research, I identified that fruit plays an important role in addressing several of these health concerns, as it is a natural source of essential vitamins, minerals, and fibre. However, despite its benefits, fruit consumption is often inconsistent due to factors such as cost, convenience, lack of education around nutritional value, and uncertainty about how to incorporate fruit into daily meals.</p>
            <p>This insight informed the direction of the website by emphasizing accessibility, education, and simplicity. The platform aims to help users make informed, healthier food choices by clearly communicating the benefits of fruit, offering practical usage ideas, and presenting information in a way that is easy to understand and culturally relevant to a South African audience.</p>

        <div class = "wireframes">
            <h2>Wireframes</h2>
            <p>Before beginning the development phase, I created low-fidelity and mid-fidelity wireframes to better understand how users would navigate the website. This process helped me visualise content placement, refine functionality, and identify potential usability issues early in the design process.</p>

        <div class = "problems">
            <h2>Problems Faced</h2>
            <h3>Problem 1- API Down ❌</h3>
            <p>At first I had a public API that had information regarding fruit nutrients and other essential details but after a week the API was temporarily unavailable. The API was essential in displaying my data visualizations.</p>
            <h3>Solution ✅</h3>
            <p>Changing the theme of my website was not an option so I decided to take a more medical approach that displayed Covid-19 statistics to emphasize the need for users to invest in healthy living and show them the need to opt for healthier options such as fruits which improve their immune system which is essential.</p>
            <h3>Problem 2- Hard information to understand ❌</h3>
            <p>Information about nutrition is often too scientific or overwhelming leading to users not knowing which fruits help with specific health needs (e.g. energy immunity).</p>
            <h3>Solution ✅</h3>
            <p>I simplified the content using plain language, and highlighted the benefits of eating fruits into 10 points. </p>
        </div>

        <div class = "design-system">
            <h2>Design System</h2>
            <p>Here are some of the design choices I’ve made for this website. The focus was on keeping the experience clean, accessible, and visually balanced, while making sure the content remains the main point of attention. </p>
            <h3>Color Palette</h3>
            <img src="../Images/ColourPalette.jpg" alt="Fruits Website Colour Palette">
            <p>The colour palette was carefully chosen to create a calm, engaging, and health-focused visual experience. A soft light greyish white (#EFF0ED) replaced pure white to reduce harsh contrast and visual strain, providing a clean background that allows vibrant fruit imagery to stand out. Warm, fruit-inspired tones such as light orange (#CDC6BA), vibrant yellow (#FADD1C), light red (#AE453B), and maroon (#A73B3F) were used to distinguish different fruit plans, visually reinforcing their natural associations while evoking feelings of warmth, positivity, vitality, and freshness. Green (#3D7341) represents nature, health, and sustainability, strengthening the website’s wellness-focused identity and building trust with users. Black (#000000) was selected for text to ensure strong contrast and clear readability across the site.</p>
            <h3>Fonts</h3>
            <img src="../Images/Fonts.jpg" alt="Fruits Website Fonts">
            <p>Poppins was chosen as the primary typeface due to its clean, modern design and range of weights, which help establish clear visual hierarchy and improve readability across headings and body text. Its rounded forms create a friendly, approachable tone that complements the fruit-themed, health-focused nature of the website. Montserrat was selected for the footer to provide subtle contrast while maintaining visual consistency. Its strong readability at smaller sizes makes it well-suited for informational content, and its professional appearance helps reinforce the website’s credibility.</p>

                <h3>Learning 📖</h3>
                <p><strong>Research-led design:</strong> Academic and contextual research helped me design based on real user needs, not assumptions.</p>
                <p><strong>Simplifying information:</strong> Breaking down complex nutritional info into clear, scannable content improved usability.</p>
                <p><strong>Wireframing early:</strong> Low and mid-fidelity wireframes revealed layout and navigation issues before high-fidelity design.</p>
                <p><strong>Design influencess behaviour:</strong> Visual hierarchy, colour, and content placement guided users toward healthier choices.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="reflection-card challenges">
                <h3>Challenges ⚠️</h3>
                <p><strong>Mobile optimization:</strong> Designing an interface that works well on small screens while keeping content clear was a challenge.</p>
                <p><strong>Content prioritization:</strong> Deciding which fruits, health tips, and features to highlight first required careful planning.</p>
