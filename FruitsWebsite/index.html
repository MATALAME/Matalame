            <p>Project Name: Fruit Website </p>
            <p>Project Type: 2024 Final Exam Project</p>
            <p>Platform: Website</p>
            <p>My role: UI/UX and Web developer</p>
            <p>Tools used: HTML, JavaScript, CSS and D3.js</p>

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>I designed a fruit-themed e-commerce website centered around a specific theme using public APIs. I worked as the sole UI/UX developer and web developer, handling both the design and technical parts of the website which included the planning, research, wireframes, and code.</p>
                <p>The website allows users to purchase fruit-based diet plans and emphasizes credibility through customer testimonials and informative content that supports safe purchasing decisions. Additionally, the site features a D3.js data visualization that presents weight gain and weight loss trends, helping users identify which fruits are suitable for their body goals.</p>

        <div class = "competitive-analysis">
            <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
            <p>Before starting the project, I did a competitive analysis to identify the design patterns and trends of existing food based subscription websites to better understand the user flow and packaging of these websites.</p>
            <h3>These websites included</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Hello Fresh</li>
                <li>Blue Apron</li>
                <li>Gold Belly</li>
                <li>Sun Basket</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class = "user-research">
            <p>To better understand the target user, I began by researching common health conditions affecting people in South Africa. This research was conducted using academic sources found on Google Scholar, which highlighted that many South Africans face diet-related health challenges such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and vitamin deficiencies. These conditions are often linked to limited access to nutritious food, affordability issues, and a lack of clear, practical dietary guidance. </p>
            <p>Through this research, I identified that fruit plays an important role in addressing several of these health concerns, as it is a natural source of essential vitamins, minerals, and fibre. However, despite its benefits, fruit consumption is often inconsistent due to factors such as cost, convenience, lack of education around nutritional value, and uncertainty about how to incorporate fruit into daily meals.</p>
            <p>This insight informed the direction of the website by emphasizing accessibility, education, and simplicity. The platform aims to help users make informed, healthier food choices by clearly communicating the benefits of fruit, offering practical usage ideas, and presenting information in a way that is easy to understand and culturally relevant to a South African audience.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "wireframes">
            <p>Before beginning the development phase, I created low-fidelity and mid-fidelity wireframes to better understand how users would navigate the website. This process helped me visualise content placement, refine functionality, and identify potential usability issues early in the design process.</p>

        <div class = "problems">
            <h3>Problem 1: API Down</h3>
            <p>At first I had a public API that had information regarding fruit nutrients and other essential details but after a week the API was temporarily unavailable. The API was essential in displaying my data visualizations.</p>
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>Changing the theme of my website was not an option so I decided to take a more medical approach that displayed Covid-19 statistics to emphasize the need for users to invest in healthy living and show them the need to opt for healthier options such as fruits which improve their immune system which is essential.</p>
            <h3>Problem 2: Hard information to understand</h3>
            <p>Information about nutrition is often too scientific or overwhelming leading to users not knowing which fruits help with specific health needs (e.g. energy immunity).</p>
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>I simplified the content using plain language, and highlighted the benefits of eating fruits into 10 points. </p>

            <h3>Learning</h3>
            <p><strong>Research-led design:</strong>Academic and contextual research helped me design based on real user needs, not assumptions.</p>
            <p><strong>Simplifying information:</strong>Breaking down complex nutritional info into clear, scannable content improved usability.</p>
            <p><strong>Wireframing early:</strong>Low and mid-fidelity wireframes revealed layout and navigation issues before high-fidelity design.</p>
            <p><strong>Design influence behaviour</strong>Visual hierarchy, colour, and content placement guided users toward healthier choices.</p>

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p><strong>Mobile optiization:</strong>Designing an interface that works well on small screens while keeping content clear was a challenge.</p>
            <p><strong>Content priortization:</strong>Deciding which fruits, health tips, and features to highlight first required careful planning.</p>
