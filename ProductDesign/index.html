            <h1>Packaging Design</h1>
            <p>This is a curated selection of client and personal projects that sit alongside my UI/UX work, showcasing how design thinking can extend across different mediums. While my portfolio focuses on creating intuitive, user-centred digital experiences, these projects allowed me to explore visual communication, branding, and packaging design. Each piece reflects a deliberate approach to colour, composition, and storytelling, highlighting how thoughtful design can create memorable, meaningful experiences—both on-screen and in the physical world.</p>

            <p>This project involved designing custom box packaging for JDJ Enterprise, a startup courier company seeking a more distinctive and memorable alternative to standard brown packaging. The goal was to introduce personality and brand identity into a functional shipping box. </p>
            <p>The walking man silhouette was used as a core visual element to symbolise movement, progress, and the company’s ongoing journey to reliably deliver parcels to customers. The final design balances practicality with character, helping the brand stand out while reinforcing its purpose.</p>

            <p>Tender Courier is a personal exploration that builds upon a previous courier packaging concept. After finalising a client version, this iteration allowed for further experimentation with colour, contrast, and brand presence.</p>
            <p>A bold black and red palette was chosen to communicate strength, urgency, and reliability, while refining the overall visual impact. The project served as an opportunity to iterate on earlier design decisions and strengthen packaging consistency within the courier sector.</p>
