            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Our project is a student-focused, React-based web application designed to connect university and college students with short-term, flexible job opportunities that fit around their academic schedules. </p>
            <p>The platform aims to empower students financially by providing an additional source of income, particularly for those in South Africa who face ongoing financial challenges and often rely on limited allowances, bursaries, or family support that do not fully cover their essential needs. </p>
            <p>At the same time, the application serves clients by connecting them with reliable young individuals who are willing to take on short-term tasks that clients may not have the time, skills, or capacity to complete themselves.</p>

            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <p><strong>Secondary Research: </strong>We reviewed existing literature on student financial stress in South Africa to ground the problem in real-world context. This helped validate the need for a flexible income solution and informed feature prioritisation.</p>
            <p><strong>Competitive Analysis: </strong>We analysed established platforms such as LinkedIn, Airbnb, WhatsApp, and local job marketplaces to understand common patterns in onboarding, navigation, messaging, and trust-building features (ratings, profiles, notifications).</p>
            <p><strong>Persona Development: </strong>Based on our research and personal experience as students, we created multiple user personas representing both students and clients, each with distinct goals, constraints, and motivations.</p>
            <p><strong>Heuristic Evaluation: </strong>We applied Nielsen’s usability principles (learnability, efficiency, memorability, error prevention, satisfaction) to evaluate our wireframes and prototype, guiding iterative design decisions.</p>

            <h2>Problems Faced</h2>
            <h3>Problem 1- Difficulty finding relevant jobs quickly ❌</h3>
            <p>Early versions of the app displayed job listings without sufficient filtering, making it harder for students to find relevant opportunities.</p>
            <h3>Solution ✅</h3>
            <p>We introduced category-based filters and planned future enhancements such as location and time-posted filters to improve discoverability and efficiency.</p>

            <h3>Problem 2- Hard information to understand ❌</h3>
            <p>Early job listings did not provide any indication of a student’s reliability, which could discourage clients from posting or accepting applications.</p>
            <h3>Solution ✅</h3>
            <p>We introduced a rating and review system that allows users to evaluate each other after job completion, adding transparency and increasing user confidence in the platform.</p>

            <h3>Problem 3- Weak Security ❌</h3>
            <p>Earlier iterations allowed users to navigate the app without authentication which broke the sense of security and made personalised features (profiles, job applications) feel unreliable.</p>
            <h3>Solution ✅</h3>
            <p>We introduced protected routes and backend-supported authentication, ensuring users must sign in before accessing core </p>
        </div>

        <div class = "wireframes">
            <h2>Wireframes</h2>
            <p>These wireframes show the early design ideas for the Student Hustle app and give an overview of how the main screens are laid out. They were created to reflect how the final app is expected to look and feel, helping to visualise the structure before development begins. While designing the wireframes, I focused on how users would move through the app and interact with each screen. The user journey starts with an introduction that explains the purpose of the app, then guides users into creating a profile where they can share their details and skills. From there, users are taken to the job-finding section, where they can browse and explore available opportunities. The overall aim of these wireframes is to keep the experience simple, clear, and easy to follow, so students can quickly understand the app and find jobs without unnecessary complexity.</p>
            <h3>Introduction to app</h3>
            <img src = "../Images/WireframeDisplay1.png" alt = "Wireframe of the introduction screen of the Student Hustle application">
            <p> These wireframes highlight the user’s journey from the very start of the application. Users are first introduced to a series of screens that explain the purpose of the app and its main features. This introduction then naturally leads them to the sign-up page, helping new users understand what the app offers before creating an account.</p>
            <h3>Create Profile</h3>
            <img src = "../Images/WireframeDisplay2.png" alt = "Wireframe of the create profile screen of the Student Hustle application">
            <p>These wireframes focus on the sign-up process, where users are required to enter necessary information such as their name, address, and other relevant details. Due to the nature of the application, additional information is required to make the platform more secure and reliable. This helps create a sense of trust between clients and student workers. The inclusion of terms and conditions also encourages respectful and appropriate use of the application.</p>
            <h3>Find Jobs</h3>
            <img src = "../Images/WireframeDisplay3.png" alt = "Wireframe of the find jobs screen of the Student Hustle application">
            <p>These wireframes show the home page, where users can access available job opportunities. Jobs are organised into different categories to make browsing easier. The wireframes also demonstrate the journey from viewing a job listing to accessing more detailed information and contacting the client who posted the job.</p>

        <div class = "reflection">
            <h2>Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Iteration improves clarity and cohesion:</strong> Revisiting and refining existing features created a smoother, more connected user journey than continuously adding new functionality.</p>
            <p><strong>Trust is a core UX principle:</strong> Ratings, reviews, and secure access transformed the platform from a simple job board into a credible digital marketplace.</p>
            <p><strong>Authentication and protected routes:</strong> significantly influence user trust and perceived platform credibility.</p>
