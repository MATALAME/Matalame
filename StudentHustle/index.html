            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Our project is a student-focused, React-based web application designed to connect university and college students with short-term, flexible job opportunities that fit around their academic schedules. </p>
            <p>The platform aims to empower students financially by providing an additional source of income, particularly for those in South Africa who face ongoing financial challenges and often rely on limited allowances, bursaries, or family support that do not fully cover their essential needs. </p>
            <p>At the same time, the application serves clients by connecting them with reliable young individuals who are willing to take on short-term tasks that clients may not have the time, skills, or capacity to complete themselves.</p>

        <div class = "user-research">
            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <p><strong>Secondary Research: </strong>We reviewed existing literature on student financial stress in South Africa to ground the problem in real-world context. This helped validate the need for a flexible income solution and informed feature prioritisation.</p>
            <p><strong>Competitive Analysis: </strong>We analysed established platforms such as LinkedIn, Airbnb, WhatsApp, and local job marketplaces to understand common patterns in onboarding, navigation, messaging, and trust-building features (ratings, profiles, notifications).</p>
            <p><strong>Persona Development: </strong>Based on our research and personal experience as students, we created multiple user personas representing both students and clients, each with distinct goals, constraints, and motivations.</p>
            <p><strong>Heuristic Evaluation: </strong>We applied Nielsen’s usability principles (learnability, efficiency, memorability, error prevention, satisfaction) to evaluate our wireframes and prototype, guiding iterative design decisions.</p>

        <div class = "problems">
            <h3>Problem 1: Difficulty finding relevant jobs quickly</h3>
            <p>Early versions of the app displayed job listings without sufficient filtering, making it harder for students to find relevant opportunities.</p>
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>We introduced category-based filters and planned future enhancements such as location and time-posted filters to improve discoverability and efficiency.</p>

            <h3>Problem 2: Hard information to understand </h3>
            <p>Early job listings did not provide any indication of a student’s reliability, which could discourage clients from posting or accepting applications.</p>
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>We introduced a rating and review system that allows users to evaluate each other after job completion, adding transparency and increasing user confidence in the platform.</p>

            <h3>Problem 3</h3>
            <p>Earlier iterations allowed users to navigate the app without authentication which broke the sense of security and made personalised features (profiles, job applications) feel unreliable.</p>
            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p>We introduced protected routes and backend-supported authentication, ensuring users must sign in before accessing core </p>

            <h2>Learning</h2>
            <p><strong>Iteration improves clarity and cohesion:</strong> Revisiting and refining existing features created a smoother, more connected user journey than continuously adding new functionality.</p>
            <p><strong>Trust is a core UX principle:</strong> Ratings, reviews, and secure access transformed the platform from a simple job board into a credible digital marketplace.</p>
            <p><strong>Authentication and protected routes:</strong> significantly influence user trust and perceived platform credibility.</p>
