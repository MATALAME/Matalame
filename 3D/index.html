            <h1>3D Visualization</h1>
            <p>This section showcases a selection of 3D visualization projects that highlight my ability to create immersive and detailed digital models. These projects demonstrate my proficiency in 3D design software and my understanding of spatial relationships, lighting, and texture. Each piece reflects a commitment to realism and creativity, bringing concepts to life through three-dimensional representation.</p>

            <h2>Kitchen Design</h2>
            <p>This project explores a modern, minimalist kitchen designed for a clean, open feel. The kitchen is centered around a spacious island, designed for food preparation and informal dining, while creating a sense of connectivity in the space.</p>
            <p>The layout emphasizes simplicity and functionality, with uncluttered surfaces and a cohesive color palette that balances light wood tones with white countertops. The aim was to create a space that’s practical, and stylish, with careful attention to lighting, materials, and overall composition.</p>

            <h2>Luxury Master Suite</h2>
            <p>This visualization highlights the mood and ambiance of a contemporary master bedroom, designed with a refined, neutral color palette and rich textures to create a calming, luxurious retreat. </p>
            <p>The design emphasizes harmony between materials, color, and spatial layout, creating a space that feels both elegant and inviting. The primary focus of this project was a detailed lighting study, showcasing the use of layered light sources.</p>

            <h2>Studio Apartment Digital Twin</h2>
            <p>This project presents a complete physical-to-digital visualization of a compact, multi-functional studio apartment. The aim was to accurately recreate an existing physical space as a detailed digital twin, emphasizing both spatial realism and design efficiency.</p>
            <p>The visualization highlights key areas — the living zone, compact kitchen, workspace, and bathroom — showcasing thoughtful lighting, material accuracy, and spatial composition to bring the apartment’s atmosphere to life.</p>

            <h2>Virtual Reality Documentary</h2>
            <p>This is my final-year Virtual Reality exam. We were tasked to create a VR documentary of an elderly person of our choice. For this project, I outsourced the characters and furniture for the scene. Our story takes place in the South African 90s, and I created a living room, sitting area, and kitchen to fit that mood using theoutsourced models. </p>
            <p>We were also tasked to use the principles of VR such as proximity, light, and colour. I was responsible for the Title Card, Chapter 1, and Chapter 4 (Environment). For a better view of the VR film, click the link below.</p>
