            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>I designed another e-commerce website centred around gaming. The website allows users to browse and purchase games. It uses a free online API to display real game titles and details, with randomized pricing added to simulate a realistic store experience. </p>
            <p>The website also includes filtering options that help users find games based on their preferences, making the browsing experience smoother and more personalized. The goal was to design a clean, user-friendly interface that makes exploring and buying games intuitive and enjoyable.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>To create a seamless and intuitive experience for browsing, discovering, and purchasing games.</li>
                <li>To bridge the gap between console ecosystems and give users more freedom and choice.</li>
                <li>To support indie developers by providing a platform to showcase their work.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class = "user-research">
            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <p>The app is designed for gamers who want a central place to buy, browse, and discover games across all platforms without being limited by console brands. These users are often on the lookout for new releases, indie games, or the best deals. These gamers value convenience and flexibility, preferring a platform that makes the purchase process easy and allows them to access games across multiple consoles, depending on the compatibility of the game.</p>
            <p>According to Johnson & Luo (2019) gamers purchase games based on emotional and cultural value. This includes factors such as loyalty to a specific game series, admiration for a particular developer or studio or personal associations with the game design or legacy. In this way, purchases are often motivated not only by gameplay but also by the meaning and identity attached to the game. In the app, this cultural value is supported through detailed information about publishers, developers helping users make purchases not just based on gameplay, but also on their personal preferences and cultural attachments to the gamers or creators.</p>
